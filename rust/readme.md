## shap-are-calculator

The `shap-area-calculator` program is designed to calculate the areas of different shapes, such as rectangles, squares, and circles. The calculations are based on user input, making it an interactive example for practicing Rust programming.

## table-maker

The `table-maker` is a Rust program to generate a table using stuctures of Cell,Row and Table.Then generating json file of that data.

## json-filter

The `json-filter` is a program to designed filter out json data from file according to Conditions and write in different files.

## json-read&write

The `json-read&write` is rust program to perform read and write operation with the use of serde_json lib and perform operations between the process.

## all_in_one

The `all_in_one` program has all above functionality in one program in saparate modules which follow rust module system.

## Frequency-Task

The `frequency-task` is a module of rust to use calculate frequency and putting it into the string task.

## Table-task-with-js

The `table-task-with-js` module utilizes Node functionalities to create tables and demonstrates the practical use of wasm-pack at a high level.

## grpc-task

The `grpc-task` provides a high-level overview of how the gRPC protocol operates within the Axum framework.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run each Rust program separately using the following commands:

```bash
cargo run --bin table-maker
cargo run --bin area_of_shapes
cargo run --bin json-filter
cargo run --bin all_in_one
cargo run --bin frequency-task
cargo run --bin table-task-with-js
cargo run --bin grpc-task-server
```
